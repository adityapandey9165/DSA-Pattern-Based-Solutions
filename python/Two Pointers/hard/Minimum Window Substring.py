LeetCode: 76. Minimum Window Substring (Hard)
Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/
Author: Aditya Pandey
Date: 2025-10-02

Problem:
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, 
return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t 
(including duplicates) is included in the window. 
If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

Pattern: Sliding Window (two pointers + hashmap)

Approach:
1. Use two dictionaries (or Counters):
   - t_count: frequency of chars in t
   - window: frequency of chars in current window [l..r] of s
2. Expand right pointer `r` â†’ add chars to window
3. If all required chars are satisfied (`matches == len(t_count)`), shrink left pointer `l`
   to minimize window while still satisfying condition.
4. Track minimum window length and result substring.
