LeetCode: 169. Majority Element (Easy)
Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
Author: Aditya Pandey
Date: 2025-09-04

Problem:
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n / 2) times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Approaches:
1) Hash map / Frequency count (intuitive)
   - Count occurrences of each value; the one with count > n//2 is the majority.
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

2) Boyerâ€“Moore Voting Algorithm (optimal)
   - Maintain a candidate and a counter.
   - Increment counter when same as candidate, decrement otherwise.
   - When counter drops to 0, pick new candidate.
   - At the end the candidate is the majority (guaranteed to exist).
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) for Boyer-Moore, O(n) for hashmap approach.

Common Mistakes:
- Not handling negative numbers or zeros specially (not needed here).
- Using integer division incorrectly when checking n/2 (use n // 2).
- Assuming majority element exists in other variants (here it's guaranteed).
